# CellularAutomataY2
A Cellular Automata made in C.

Generally, a cellular automaton (CA) is a regular grid of cells. Each cell can exist in one of a finite number of states(on or off) at a particular point in time. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. The new generation of the automata is generated by a 'rule' that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood

This project demonstrates the different types of patterns generated by a Cellular Automata for any rule and size of your choice. 

Possible extensions I would like to implement in the future include the following:

-Graphics 

-2D Automata
