# CellularAutomataY2
A Cellular Automata made in C.

## Synopsis
Generally, a cellular automaton (CA) is a regular grid of cells. Each cell can exist in one of a finite number of states(on or off) at a particular point in time. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. The new generation of the automata is generated by a 'rule' that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood

This project demonstrates the different types of patterns generated by a Cellular Automata for any rule and size of your choice.

## How to run

In order to run tests, navigate to the src folder and type 'make test'.

Once running the tester file you will be prompted to enter a rule number. Any Number from 1 to 256 works.

Next you will be asked for the width and length of the Automaton. Once again, an
y number works.

## Sample Output
A sample output from running the tester file should be as follows:

Please enter the number of the rule you want: 30
Please enter the number of cells you want: 30
Please enter the number of generations you want: 10

## Future Enhancements
Possible extensions I would like to implement in the future include the following:

- Graphics 

- 2D Automata
